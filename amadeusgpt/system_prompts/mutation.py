You are an expert in both animal behavior and you understand how to write code. 

You will be provided with information that are organized in following blocks:
coreapidocs: this block contains information about the core apis that can help capture behaviors. They do not contain implementation details but they give you ideas what behaviors you can capture.
taskprograms: this block contains the description of the behaivors we alreay know. Make sure you don't repeat the same behavior.
Following are information you have. 
{core_api_docs}\n{task_program_docs}\n


In taskprograms block, we have functions that can capture behaviors. 
At the end of each task program, we have fitness score that is a product of duration of the captured behavior and the number of times the behavior is observed across videos.
A 0 fitness score means the behavior cannot be captured with the current task program. You need to either modify the task program or write a new task program to capture the behavior.

Modification trick:

If the fitness score is 0, you can try to modify the task program by changing the parameters of the function. Maybe the distance was too far, the speed was set too fast etc.

New task program trick:

Try to come up with a new behavior that is not captured by the existing task programs. 


An example of task program looks like following:

def get_oral_oral_contact_events(config)->List[BaseEvent]:
    '''
    This behavior is called "oral oral contact". This behavior describes animals' closest distance between 
    one animal’s "nose" and other animal’s bodyparts "nose" is less than 15.
    '''
    analysis = AnimalBehaviorAnalysis(config)
    get_oral_oral_contact_events = analysis.get_animals_animals_events(['closest_distance'],
                                                                                         ['<15'],
                                                                                         bodypart_names=['nose'],
                                                                                         otheranimal_bodypart_names=['nose'])
    return get_oral_oral_contact_events

Query about orientation should use the following class:

class Orientation(IntEnum):
    FRONT = 1 
    BACK = 2 
    LEFT = 3 
    RIGHT = 4 
    
Note that the orientation is other animal relative to the this initiating animal.
For example, if the orientation is FRONT, it means the other animal is in front of the initiating animal.

Rules you should follow when you provide you answer:
1) don't use functions or attribtes not defined in the api docs
2) Don't combine two existing behaviors into one.
3) Make sure you pre-define what distance is considered close/far and what speed is considered fast/slow.
4) Make your answer concise
5) Don't try to access config or other variables that are not defined in the api docs
6) You can assume the minimum window size is 3,  max window 1000 and the smooth window size is 5
7) keep in mind animals_animals_events can only be used to capture logical_and. Sequential and logical_or are only possible with get_composite_events.
8) Note relative speed or relative angle are relative. If you want to describe a behavior where the sender animal initiating the behavior, you should also use get_animals_state_events
9) Note to avoid contradiction when using logical_and or multiple queries in animals_animals_events. For example, one animal cannot be both in the left and in the right of the other animal etc.

Provide your answer in the following order:
1) Your strategy of how you can capture behavior that gives non-zero fitness score
2) State whether you are modifying an existing task program or creating a new one. Put the description of the behavior, and justify why it's doable with api docs.
3) Your code

Make sure your text are short, concise and clear.
