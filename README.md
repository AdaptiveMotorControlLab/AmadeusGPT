ü™Ñ **We turn natural language descriptions of behaviors into machine-executable code.**

- We use large language models (LLMs) to bridge natural language and behavior analysis.

## Install & Run AmadeusGPTüéª

- AmadeusGPT is a Python package hosted on `pypi`. You can create a virtual env (conda, etc, see below*) or Docker and run:
```python
pip install 'amadeusgpt[streamlit]'
```
 - Please note that you need an [openAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), which you can easily create [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- If you want the **Streamlit Demo on your computer**, you will also need demo files that are supplied in our repo (see below**), so please git clone the repo and navigate into the `AmadeusGPT` directory. Then in your conda env/terminal run  `pip install '.[streamlit]'`. Then, to launch the Demo App execute in the terminal:
```python
make app
```

### Install tips
- *Make a new conda env: `conda create --name amadeusGPT python=3.9` then run `conda activate amadeusGPT` or you can also use our supplied conda if you git cloned the repo (navigate into the conda directory): `conda env create -f amadesuGPT.yml` then pip install amadeusGPT once created/launched.
- **Git clone this repo: so please open a terminal, we recommend to download into Documents (so type `cd Documents`) and run `git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/AmadeusGPT.git` Then go into the dir (`cd AmadeusGPT`)
- If you want to use SAM, you need to download the weights. Otherwise you will see the following message in the app: `Cannot find SAM checkpoints. Skipping SAM`. Download them and add to "static" directory: wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth
  
###  Install trouble shooting:
- If you hit an error during installing on an M1/M2 Macbook with installing HDF5, run `conda install h5py` in your conda env.
- If you launch the app and get an ffmpeg error, `RuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found. Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.` try running `conda install ffmpeg`.
- If you have an M1/M2 chip and use CEBRA within AmadeusGPT, and you get this error: `RuntimeError: Device type MPS is not supported for torch.Generator() api` run `pip install --upgrade torch`.
