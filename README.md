- We use large language models (LLMs) to bridge natural language and behavior analysis.

## Install & Run AmadeusGPTüéª

### Install with `pypi`

- AmadeusGPT is a Python package hosted on `pypi`. You can create a virtual env (conda, etc, see below*) and run:
```python
pip install 'amadeusgpt[streamlit]'
```
Note that in order to access our demo video and keypoint files, we recommend to install from the source. [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md).



### Setup OpenAI API Key to use AmadeusGPT

**Why OpenAI API Key is needed** AmadeusGPT relies on API calls of OpenAI (we will add more options in the future) for language understanding and code writing.

You can either add this into your environment by following:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your API key' 
```

Or inside your python script or jupyter notebook, add this line in the beginning of the file


```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = 'your api key' 
```

- Please note that you need an [openAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), which you can easily create [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).



### Try AmadeusGPT with local web app
```python
make app
```

### Do I need to provide keypoint files?
- If you only provide the raw video file, we use SuperAnimal models [SuperAnimal models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48792-2) to predict your video. This is only supported with cpu or gpu installation. While we highly recommend gpu installation, we are working on faster, light-weight superanimal models to work on your CPU.
- If you already have keypoint file corresponding to the video file, look up how we set-up the config file in the notebooks.  Right now we only support keypoint output from DeepLabCut. Other keypoint formats can be added upon feature requests.


### Try AmadeusGPT with our example notebooks
We provide example notebooks at [Notebooks](notebook)

### Notebook as use-case demo

1) Draw ROI and ask when is the animal in the ROI.  [Demo](notebook/EPM_demo.ipynb)
2) Obtain the binary mask for retrieved masks (for further sampling such as neural data pairing) [Demo](notebook/EPM_demo.ipynb)
3) Use SuperAnimal video inference (make sure you use gpu or cpu installation) if you don't have corresponding DeepLabCut keypoint file [Demo](notebook/custom_mouse_demo.ipynb)
4) Write you own integration modules and use them [Demo](notebook/Horse_demo.ipynb) [Source code](amadeusgpt/integration_modules). Make sure you delete the cached modules_embedding.pickle if you add new modules
5) Multi-Animal social interaction.  [Demo](notebook/MABe_demo.ipynb)
6) Reuse the task program generated by LLM and run it on different videos [Demo](notebook/MABe_demo.ipynb)
7) You can ask one query across multiple videos. Put your keypoint-video file pairs in the same folder and specify the data_folder as Done in [Demo](notebook/custom_mouse_video.ipynb). Make sure your video file and (DLC) keypoint file follows the convention prefix.mp4 prefix*.h5.
